Chris,

The proposal was not in the required folder. Please organize your repository.

The project idea seems interesting; however: 
  - it is not clear exactly how the DFA will be used.

Use java if you can.

Here is a paper that might help you along the way (heavy on theory though):

Muscholl, Anca, Thomas Schwentick, and Luc Segoufin. "Active context-free
games." Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science. Springer
Berlin Heidelberg, 2004.
